# Abstract 
This work presents a novel approach for landslide detection that integrates Digital Image Correlation (DIC) with Random Forest based vegetation segmentation using positioned camera systems. The methodology combines real-time motion detection through FFT-based cross-correlation with vegetation masking to effectively filter out vegetation-induced noise which enhance landslide/change detection accuracy in mountainous terrain. The integration of multi-modal feature extraction with morphological post-processing achieves robust landslide identification with high precision and computational efficiency. Experimental results show significant improvements in detection accuracy, particularly in complex terrain with mixed vegetation coverage while computational efficiency enables real-time monitoring applications.

## Key contributions include:
1. **Integrated Processing Pipeline:** A sequential approach that first applies DIC to estimate displacement vectors and then uses vegetation segmentation to exclude vegetation regions, resulting in more reliable landslide motion detection.
2. **DIC Implementation:** Application of FFT-based DIC with subpixel refinement, adapted for landslide detection. The implementation retains extensibility for incorporating subset-shape functions to further improve motion-tracking precision with higher-resolution imagery.
3. **Feature-Based Vegetation Classification:** Development of a comprehensive feature set (45-dimensional) for accurate vegetation classification, improving the segmentation process and minimizing its impact on displacement estimation.
